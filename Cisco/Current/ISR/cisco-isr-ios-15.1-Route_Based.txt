! Microsoft Corporation
! Windows Azure Virtual Network

! This configuration template applies to Cisco ISR 2900 Series Integrated Services Routers running IOS 15.1.
! It configures an IPSec VPN tunnel connecting your on-premise VPN device with the Azure gateway.

! Things that begin with "azure-" are variable names and can be changed consistently.

! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! ACL rules
!
! Proper ACL rules are needed for permitting cross-premise network traffic.
! You should also allow inbound UDP/ESP traffic for the interface which will be used for the IPSec tunnel.
! In this example 10.0.0.0/8 is the on premises network & 192.168.0.0/16 is the Azure Virtual Network
! In this example the Azure Gateway IP Address is 40.76.X.X and your Outside Interface IP Address is 131.X.X.X

access-list 101 permit ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 102 permit udp host 40.76.X.X eq isakmp host 131.X.X.X
access-list 102 permit esp host 40.76.X.X host 131.X.X.X

! This section specifies the authentication, encryption, hashing, and Diffie-Hellman group parameters for the Phase
! 1 negotiation and the main mode security association.
! In this example the Azure Gateway IP Address is 40.76.X.X

! Crypto map configuration
!
! This section defines a crypto profile that binds the cross-premise network traffic to the IPSec transform set and remote peer.
! We also bind the IPSec policy to the virtual tunnel interface, through which cross-premise traffic will be transmitted.
! We have picked an arbitrary tunnel id "1" as an example. If that happens to conflict with an existing virtual tunnel interface,
! you may choose to use a different id.
! The IP address 169.254.0.1 acts as the “inner” address of the tunnel. Essentially it has one job, to deliver traffic from the Azure side
! to the on-prem side. As it does not need to reach the Internet, it being routable is not necessary. The ISR has an internal routing table
! and knows what to do with the traffic. You should be able to use any 169.254.X.X address.
