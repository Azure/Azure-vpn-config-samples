! This configuration template applies to Cisco ISR 2900 Series Integrated Services Routers running IOS 15.1.
! It configures an IPSec VPN tunnel connecting your on-premise VPN device with the Azure gateway.
! Azure virtual network address space in this example is 10.149.0.0/16
! On premises local network connected to ISR G0/0 is 192.168.0.0/16
! Outside interface in ISR is G0/1

! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! ACL rules
! 
! Proper ACL rules are needed for permitting cross-premise network traffic.
! You should also allow inbound UDP/ESP traffic for the interface which will be used for the IPSec tunnel.
! You should also allow below whichever traffic needed on the outgoing interface to make sure you dont block necessary traffic

access-list 103 permit ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 10.149.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 103 permit udp host <azure gateway ip> eq isakmp host <public ip of outgoing interface>
access-list 103 permit esp host <azure gateway ip> host <public ip of outgoing interface>

! This section defines a crypto profile that binds the cross-premise network traffic to the IPSec transform
! set and remote peer.  We also bind the IPSec policy to the virtual tunnel interface, through which 
! cross-premise traffic will be transmitted.  We have picked an arbitrary tunnel id "1" as an example. If
! that happens to conflict with an existing virtual tunnel interface, you may choose to use a different id.
